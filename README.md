# 🎯 Flutter Quiz Learning App

## 📋 Project Details

**Name:** Flutter Quiz Learning App

**Description:** A comprehensive quiz learning application built with Flutter, designed for both web and mobile platforms. This time-boxed coding assessment demonstrates senior-level Flutter development skills with clean architecture, state management, and responsive design. The app features a complete quiz ecosystem with user progress tracking, multiple categories, and an engaging user interface.

## 🏗️ Code Architecture

**Approach:** Utilizes the **Three-layer Clean Architecture** with **Flutter Bloc** for state management.

### **Why Three-layer Clean Architecture?**

This architecture provides a clear **separation of concerns**, ensuring each layer focuses on its specific responsibilities:

- **Domain Layer**: Handles business logic and data transformations
- **Data Layer**: Manages data fetching and persistence
- **Presentation Layer**: Deals with rendering the UI and responding to user interactions

This setup promotes **maintainability, testability, and scalability** of the application.

### **Why Flutter Bloc for State Management?**

- **Separation of Concerns**: BLoC distinctly separates business logic from UI components
- **Reactive Nature**: The UI updates efficiently in response to state changes
- **State Management**: Provides an organized way to manage state across complex applications
- **Testability**: Excellent support for unit testing and mocking

### **Why Feature-First Folder Structure?**

Feature-based organization for larger applications introduces an **API interface for each feature**. This approach:

- Hides implementation details behind API interfaces
- Enables clean communication between features
- Improves modularity and simplifies management
- Follows **Single Responsibility Principle**

## 🔗 How All Layers Are Connected?

All layers are connected through **Dependency Injection** using **GetIt**:

- **Domain Layer** defines repository interfaces and use cases
- **Data Layer** implements these interfaces with concrete repositories
- **Presentation Layer** depends only on domain abstractions
- **GetIt** provides the concrete implementations at runtime

## 📂 Structure Breakdown

### **lib/main.dart**
Application entry point that initializes dependencies and runs the app.

### **lib/core/**
Centralizes utilities for modularity and consistency:
- **di/injection.dart**: Dependency injection configuration
- **network/api_service.dart**: HTTP client with error handling
- **routes/app_router.dart**: Navigation configuration
- **theme/app_theme.dart**: Consistent theming
- **utils/responsive.dart**: Responsive design helpers

### **lib/features/** (Feature-Based Modules)

Each feature follows a consistent structure:

#### **Home Feature Example:**
```
home/
├── data/
│   ├── models/
│   │   └── user_model.dart          # Data serialization
│   │   └── category_model.dart      # Category data model
│   └── repositories/                # Repository implementations
├── domain/
│   ├── entities/
│   │   └── user.dart               # Core business objects
│   │   └── category.dart           # Category entity
│   ├── repositories/
│   │   └── home_repository.dart    # Repository interfaces
│   └── usecases/                   # Business logic
├── presentation/
│   ├── bloc/
│   │   ├── home_bloc.dart         # State management
│   │   ├── home_event.dart        # Events
│   │   └── home_state.dart        # States
│   ├── pages/
│   │   └── home_page.dart         # UI screens
│   └── widgets/                   # Reusable components
│       ├── user_header.dart       # User profile widget
│       └── category_card.dart     # Category selection card
```

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### **Test Structure:**
- **Unit Tests**: Domain entities and use cases (`test/features/quiz/domain/`)
- **Widget Tests**: UI components and interactions
- **Integration Tests**: Complete user flows

### **Running Tests:**
```bash
# Run all tests
flutter test

# Run with coverage
flutter test --coverage

# Run specific test files
flutter test test/features/quiz/domain/entities/question_test.dart
flutter test test/features/quiz/domain/usecases/fetch_questions_test.dart
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### **Prerequisites**
- Flutter SDK (3.24.3 or higher)
- Dart SDK (3.8.1 or higher)

### **Installation & Running**

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

2. **Run on different platforms:**

   **Mobile:**
   ```bash
   flutter run -d android  # or ios
   ```

   **Web:**
   ```bash
   flutter run -d chrome --web-browser-flag="--disable-web-security"
# "--disable-web-security" flag is used to bypass CORS restrictions during local development.
   # Or use provided scripts in /scripts directory
   ```
